# DNA Mutation & Evolution Analysis Suite

A collection of Python tools for processing DNA sequences and simulating genetic population changes.

## 📂 Project Files
1. **`mutation_filter.py`**: Filters harmful DNA patterns from generated sequences.
2. **`cancer_risk.py`**: Calculates polygenic disease risk using probability.
3. **`risk_categorization.py`**: Categorizes mutations into Low, Moderate, and High-risk groups using quantiles.
4. **`dna_encryption.py`**: Encrypts DNA sequences using lightweight mapping.
5. **`evolution.py`**: Simulates population evolution toward a target genetic code.

## 🚀 How to Run the Scripts
1. Make sure you have **Python 3** installed on your computer.
2. Download these files to your computer.
3. Open your terminal or command prompt in that folder.
4. Type `python` followed by the name of the file (e.g., `python evolution.py`) and press Enter.
5. Follow the on-screen prompts to enter your data.
